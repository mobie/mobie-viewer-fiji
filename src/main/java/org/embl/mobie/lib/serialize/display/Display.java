 * A display is a collection of images

 * Currently, everything that we display in MoBIE
 * is a Display. This implies that it must be
 * modelled as an Image, which essentially is a Source.
 * This is in line with BDV, which internally also
 * models everything as a Source.
 *
 * Practically, for adding a Display to BDV,
 * all images, using the display settings, will be
 * converted to SourceAndConverters.
