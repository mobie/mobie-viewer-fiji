 Note that this provides storage locations for both images and tables,

 TODO: we could split this up into two classes, one for the images and
 	one for the tables

 Images:
 One {@code StorageLocation} contains data for
 single channel volumetric time-lapse data,
 such as an {@code Source} in BigDataViewer.

	// either
	public String relativePath;
	// or
	public String absolutePath;

	// for data on s3:
	public String s3Address; // one can now also use absolutePath instead for S3
	public String signingRegion;

	// The above locations typically refer to
	// a container, which may contain multiple
	// chunks of data that are lazy loaded.
	// for images, those chunks are specified
	// by the file format.
	// For tables, we don't yet have such
	// a specification; to solve this
	// the {@code defaultChunk} points to the chunk
	// (typically a file in the {@code absolutePath} folder),
	// that contains the default columns.
	// additional available chunks may be discovered,
	// e.g. by looking into {@code absolutePath}.

	// and thus one needs to subset a potentially
	// multi-channel image data source.
	//
	// as data is opened as {@code SpimData}
	// the {@code channel} can also refer to a setup, which
	// does not need to be a fluorescence channel, but could be some
	// entirely other image, e.g. in CZI or LIF files
	//
	// also the BDV XML based files can contain multiple "setups"
	// which can be chosen from via the {@code channel} field
	//
	// historically, we only had fluorescence channels,
	// and thus the name of the variable is "channel" and cannot
	// readily be changed because we use in the MoBIE JSON spec
