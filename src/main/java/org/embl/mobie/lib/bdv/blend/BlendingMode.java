 * Constants to define the blending mode of sources.
 * These constants are used within {@link AccumulateMixedProjectorARGB}.
 *
 * Sum:
 * The ARGB values of the source will be added to the final ARGB to be displayed.
 *
 * Average:
 * The ARGB values of all sources with the Average projection mode will first be averaged
 * before being added to the final ARGB to be displayed.
 * This is useful for overlapping electron microscopy data sets.
 *
 * Occluding:
 * For a given pixel, if there are sources with the Exclusive projection mode and with
 * an alpha value larger than zero, only these source will be displayed.
 * The pixels of all other sources will not be visible.
 * This is useful, e.g., if there is a region where one source contains information
 * at a higher resolution than another source. Selecting the Exclusive projection mode
 * can be used to only show this source.
