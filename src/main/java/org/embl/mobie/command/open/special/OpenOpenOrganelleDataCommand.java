		// TODO
		// - [X] The grid overlay boundaries are too thick for some reason
		// - [X] Auto-contrast in a Transformed Grid View should be determined from an image that is currently visible!
		// - [ ] Auto-contrast in the beginning of a grid view display would be nice
		// - [X] For each RegionDisplay automatically overlay the region_id as an annotation
		// - [X] The grids should not be exclusive in this case
		// - [X] The EM should show first
		// - [ ] How to implement one Grid and RegionDisplay for many sources?
		//     - how to deal with the fact that then there are multiple table rows for each region?
		// - [ ] It would be cleaner if all the layers would be part of the same grid
		//     - this could be achieved by adding a "grid_position" column
		//     - but then we would also need a "display" column to sort the entries into the respective displays
		//     - an issue with this would be how to implement the region display, because s.a.
		// - [X] Zoom to region when clicking on a RegionTable row
		// - [ ] Yannick: exclusive column
		// - [ ] John: Membrane segmentation pixel shit in jrc_jurkat-1/labels/pm_seg
