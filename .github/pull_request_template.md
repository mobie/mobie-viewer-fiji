Thank you for contributing to mobie-viewer-fiji!

We follow this workflow for the MoBIE development:
- new features or other changes should be first merged into the 'develop' branch
  - the 'develop' branch is realeased to the MoBIE-beta update site from time to time in order to test new changes in Fiji
- for a new official release the 'develop' branch is merged into 'main'
  - and the 'main' branch is released to the official MoBIE update site

=> Please submit your PR to the 'develop' branch (unless you plan on making a full release or a quick hotfix is needed on 'main').
